# reddit-random-picture
A small project to try out VueJS.

Check it out [here](https://cosmonawt.github.io/reddit-random-pictures)!

Fetches the hottest posts from your favourite subreddits and skips through them at an interval of 7 seconds.

Uses [VueJs](https://vuejs.org), [Miligram](http://milligram.io) and [Reddit.js](https://github.com/sahilm/reddit.js).
 
 *Note:* As you can probably tell, my webdesign skills are mediocre at best, so pull requests welcome!
